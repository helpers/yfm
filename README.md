# {{yfm}} [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/yfm.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/yfm)

> Assemble utils and helpers for extracting, parsing and using YAML front matter in your templates.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1` and Assemble `~0.4.2`.

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins.

## Installation

The following options are available for downloading and adding the helpers to your project:

* [bower install yfm](https://github.com/bower/bower)
* `git clone https://github.com/assemble/yfm.git` into a directory in your project
* [download this project]() and manually add it to your project

Once the module has been downloaded, it must be enabled in Assemble's task or target options:

```js
assemble: {
  options: {
    helpers: ['vendor/yfm/*.js']
  }
  files: {
    ...
  }
}
```

If everything is installed and configured properly, you should now be able to use the helpers in your Assemble project.

Visit [assemble's documentation](http://assemble.io) to learn more about using helpers in your Assemble projects.
